- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jordan

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in growing my understanding of cloud infrastructure and technology in general.  I am interested in collaborating with groups of people.
  who are also pursuing skills in cloud computing and building infrastructure as a hobby and as a profession. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently enrolled at WGU, obtaining my bachelorâ€™s degree in cloud computing and working on multiple projects that will help me understand how AWS and Azure work.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Former first responder, into physical fitness and foodie enthusiast.
