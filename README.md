- 👋 Hey there, I’m Jordan

- I’m passionate about cloud infrastructure and continuously expanding my knowledge of emerging technologies. I’m especially interested in collaborating with like-minded individuals who are building cloud-based solutions—whether for fun, for work, or for the challenge.

- 💡 I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Cloud Computing from Western Governors University, and I’m currently diving into hands-on projects that explore both AWS and Azure environments. These projects are helping me gain practical experience in areas like infrastructure as code, automation, containerization, and CI/CD.

- 🤝 I’m always open to networking, mentorship, and collaborating on cloud-native or DevOps-oriented projects—especially with others who share a passion for learning and building cool things.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m a former first responder, an advocate for physical fitness, and a self-proclaimed foodie—always on the hunt for the next great bite.
